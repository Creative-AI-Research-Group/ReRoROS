# Recycled Robot Operating System
## Created by Craig Vear and Dmitriy Dubovitskiy

This is a basic operating system for a recycled robot based on the Pioneer series of robots e.g. Pioneer 3 and Peoplebot.

The original onboard computer from the Pioneer machines were replaced with Jetson Nano's. These were connected to the Hitachi driver processors using a serial connection via the Jetson's USB.

The operating system was wrote in Python as an expandable, easily modified system for basic motion and server reporting.
